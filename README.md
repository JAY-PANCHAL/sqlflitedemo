# SQLFlite Demo Project

This is a demo project showcasing the usage of SQLFlite in a Flutter application. In this project, we implement a simple e-commerce app where users can view a list of products, add them to their cart, and store the cart data locally using SQLFlite.

## Features

- Product listing: View a list of available products with details such as name, price, and description.
- Add to cart: Users can add products to their cart.
- Local storage: Cart data is stored locally using SQLFlite, enabling offline usage and persistent data storage.
